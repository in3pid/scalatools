Exploring Scala with an emerging set of tools for combinatorics and number theory.

Counter - element counter with multiset union and intersection.
Combinator - generate subsequences, combinations, permutations for some sequence.
NumberTool - generate compositions of N.
PrimeSieve - sieve method for generating primes, extends to new intervals.
Statistics - just a generator for geometrically distributed random numbers.
Streamers - tools for generating infinite sequences.
